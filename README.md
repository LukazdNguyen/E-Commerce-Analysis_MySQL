**SQL Project: Building operational dashboard**

In this article, we will learn how to use MySQL query language to query the overall business situation of a company on e-commerce source from Mavenfactory before building dashboards and reports that can be used in the long term.
We will focus on querying and finding the problems that the business is facing accurately and effectively, then use Power BI to create reports and dashboards that provide the most complete and easy-to-understand information. This not only saves time but also ensures that management can quickly and accurately assess the business situation and make appropriate decisions.

**Problem statement**

Specific case study: Your business is a digital e-commerce unit with electronic devices such as: phones, computers, televisions... In addition to supplying directly to consumers, your business also coordinates with agents to distribute its products. Your business data is generated daily in very large volumes. All data is stored on the MS SQL Server database system. Some specific information tables are as follows: sales data, dealer discount data, customer catalog, product catalog... â‡’ The problem: The boss asks us to build a sales report to observe revenue, sales by each website, each type of equipment and company pages,... each major customer. In addition, the boss also wants to monitor the achievement of targets
of these indicators. And importantly, the boss only wants to see the most recent months because the boss knows "if you get all the data, you will probably have to wait until tomorrow". Let's do it!

Instead of taking all the data on the database to build a sales report, we will only need to care about specific metrics and within a certain period of time. This will help us minimize redundant data in the report. Because this data will reduce our performance, this process is extremely necessary. However, to implement this solution is not simple for business managers or even individuals who manage the database. Therefore, a Data Analyst will help businesses solve this problem in the simplest and fastest way possible.
